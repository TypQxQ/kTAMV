TODO:
- Important
    - Move Content of kTAMV_FrameRequestResult to kTAMV_FrameRequestData and rename to RequestResult with added ResultType
    - Migrate from numpy in Klipper
    - Move numpy function serverside
- Less important
    - Check server side nozle detection for optimization
    - If first calibration movement is too large then move to alternate movement list and restart.
    - Set a configurable error margin for recursive nozzle detection, pixel or mm. that gets recalculated to pixel.
    - send_server_cfg error management
- Trivial
    - Add timeout inside kTAMV_utl.get_nozzle_position to config
    - Add server timeout inside server_request to config
    - Show text on image that the camera url is not working.
    - Put a confirmation text to console when running KTAMV_FIND_NOZZLE_CENTER
